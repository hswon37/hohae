"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","Lit W W","Continental Director","I was on a visit to Singapore and was staying in the YMCA One Orchard. It was situated at the start of the famous Orchard Road where most of the five stars hotels and popular shopping malls are. It is perhaps one of the most underrated hotel/motel in Singapore.  It is possible the most reasonable but best located hotel along this famous Orchard Road. It is just a walking distance from the Istana, the presidential palace of Singapore and literally next door to the National Museum. It is also a stone throw away from all the shopping malls and 15 minutes walk from the famous Clarke Quay and Marina Bay Area. The complimentary breakfast that comes with each room is simple but sumptuous.","4"

"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","Tottydownunder","Average in a good location","I stayed here for 3 nights. It is in a great location near Fort Canning and close to 2 MRT stations, so really handy for seeing that all Singapore has to offer. The rooms are small with basic facilities, but clean. The bed was as hard as a board so I didn't sleep that well. The bathroom was also small and has nowhere to put anything apart from on the floor or on the toilet cistern, so a shelf or vanity unit would have been useful.  Breakfast, although included, is very basic and quite bland and the toast is more like warmed bread than toast.  Staff are friendly, but for a similar price, there are other options close by with good service and nicer rooms.","3"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","dmfreedom","Simple. Good Location, but basically a hostel.","Well located. Close to a couple of Metro stations that get you anywhere in town.  Clean, with all the basics. But small. Think cruise ship accommodation.   Breakfast was lacking. Not enough tables and chairs. ""Continental Style"" which basically means cold meats and boiled eggs. Filter coffee as standard, proper coffee is extra. Given the amazing street food in Singapore, better to skip this.   Strange kind of model where not everything is included. You can use the gym in the morning for free, but if you want to use it in the evening there is a charge.   Check the rates. Weekends are a lot more expensive and there are better options nearby. Probably wouldn't go back.","3"

Closest MRT is Bencoolen(DT21)and it is  about 200 meters away from this place. You can visit this place from Changi Airport  via MRT with ease using down town line ( Blue). Even Dhoby Ghaut (NE6) and Bras Basah (CC2) is close-by. Plenty of eating places around this hotel and my favorite was Food Republic as there were many choices to make like bakery items, Rice and curry , Fried rice  , Noodles , Soups, Juices   etc. National museum is just two minutes walk and fort canning park and raffles park is at  just walking distance .        I spent 3 nights at this 3 star hotel. Its a small place compared to other big hotels in S'pore but feeling was superb . Felt like I'm at my home thanks to wonderful staff .¡¦","5"

We went into the hotel with positive thoughts and average expectations, taking in the fact that this is a three star hotel. The lobby was nice, modern, clean and there weren¡¯t any red flags. Seeing that the lobby is nice we got excited about going upstairs and seeing the room that we were going to stay in for the next fours days. When we exited the elevator we saw the lounging area that looked decent. We turned left on the 7th floor going to room number 719. When we entered the room we were mortified.

Breakfast also is very basic and a vegetarian will be limited only to bread toasts, corn-flakes and fruits. One of the house keeping ladies was shockingly rude; forget about politeness that one expects from some one in the service industry, she lacks even basic courtesy.

The staff were friendly and helpful.  The not so good:  The biggest disappointment was the state of the 'standard' room, which could reasonably be described as dilapidated (this was not fairly reflected in their photos online). The bathroom was mouldy with flaking paint, and the carpet was so old, stained and dirty that it was crisp (see pics).

The price is good taking into account that Singapore is quite an expensive place.  The breakfast is a little busy but you can manage to access all available food.

The room was dirty, thread bare towels and rips in bedding. We took antihistamines while staying here and also kept footwear on while in the rooms.

I stayed there twice in the last few weeks, both times with an 11 year old child.  On both occasions we had a twin room with an en suite bathroom. The rooms were small but adequate and contained everything necessary for a good stay - clean and comfortable beds, kettle, hairdryer, TV and a/c. The bathroom had a shower with instant hot water system which did not really heat the water beyond tepid in either of the 2 rooms but was okay because of Singapore's never cool climate. There was good, free wifi in the rooms and public areas. My only complaint concerns cleanliness of the rooms.

The room was spacious. They even had a phone which we could carry around for calling cabs and doing other work. Breakfast was good too, though the same everyday. Staff was very helpful and they booked a cab everyday for us.   The location was the best part about this hotel. The bus stop is right outside and the MRT station, Dhoby Ghaut is 3-5 minutes walk. It is located on the Orchard Road which is the best for shopping. Starbucks and 7-eleven Store is right opposite the road.   Stay was very convenient!","5"

You can walk everywhere from here (Clark Quay, Orchard Road, Chinatown...).  There are 3 different MRT lines from the Dhoby Ghaut station across the street.  The room itself is a good size, but overall the hotel and rooms could use an upgrade.  Windows and carpet are dirty, room smells very musty and there's lots of mold in the shower tile grout.  A simple spray of bleach and water would do wonders.  Hopefully this was just my room, but if the price were right, I still probably stay here again.","3"

It's also very close to Fort Canning, museum, art gallery etc. Bathrooms are old, linen is perhaps a little tired but everything was comfortable. A special mention to the breakfast which was great and had different options each day - we enjoyed roti chennai, steamed buns, pastries, fruit and more - all this with a great view over a park.

The rooms are pretty small, great wifi connection, lovely pool, friendly staff at reception. The location is ideal for tourists as you're pretty central to get to most attractions. Dhoby Ghaut train station is just 10 minutes walk from the hotel, and Little India (Serangoon Road) is a 15 minute walk. The only drawback is that the hotel is more of a hostel, and the walls are thin, so you do hear people coming back late at night and the opening/shutting of doors.","4"

It is as clean as the tired furniture allows. The TV did not work (I could not be bothered ringing reception as I was more focused on the damp towels). The damp towels are due to tumble drying and not drying enough for the towels. Hence it leaves the towels damp. I gave feedback to the reception on 8th Feb when I checked in.

The rooms were also provided with individual air-con.  Breakfast was complete enough.

Obviously this is not a big hotel chain.. but the rooms felt small and dated, it's not that it wasn't clean but the rooms had an aged/worn feeling. Hotel as a pool and well equipped gym, which is used by guests and outside users. A Couple bad points, I had ants in my room, not big ones and not a lot but still ants on the counters is a little off putting (I didn't lose any sleep about it). Also although the curtains were blackout the doorframe had big gaps which bled quite abit of light in from the hallway lights that were on all night.

The breakfast buffet is quite acceptable, although not included in some tariffs. Location is excelente, only 3 minutes away from exit A of Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station.  Anyway and overall, if you are on a budget (according Singapore standards) a stay at the YMCA is quite advisable, since you can get a good room rate.

Staff was friendly, helped me organize cab ride to the airport. Breakfast was very average, rather heavy on warm food (eggs etc) than bread and jams or cereal. There is only a single key to each room, which makes it difficult to room with someone if you get back to the YMCA independently (especially later at night).

Right at the start of the major road Orchard Street and literally a 3-minute walk to the amazing metro system, you are set to get anywhere easily.

The location is ok for shopping and some people on the staff are helpful, but there is just so much problems with this place that it cannot be recommended if you can book almost anything else - if you really want to stay in an outdated hostel there are way cheaper options to do it around town.

It was also very convenient for most of my friends in Singapore to meet in Dhoby Ghaut Station.

They have stopped providing coffee and tea in their rooms, reduced TV service to one English-language channel, and 3-4 additional channels that contain local language programming.  They've also reduced a few of their breakfast offerings.

Dont forget to lock your room properly.  Well, just in case.  Overall it is recommended for budget traveler.","4"

Close to a train station, and to a hawker center for quick yummy meals. It's on the edge of Orchard road and its a good 15-min walk to the center. Perfect choice for a quiet working trip in the city.","3"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","oztravellersx2","Great location and quiet too","Great location at the top of Orchard Road and close to MRT station with a bus stop at the door. Clean, comfortable room, big shower, tea and coffee making facilities, free wifi. Nice buffet breakfast and cafe for other meals or afternoon tea. Staff friendly and helpful and 24 reception with luggage storage.  Large pool on the roof, great for a swim after a days sightseeing. Can walk to loads of shopping centres and attractions eg the Raffles. Only downside was our room had a connecting door to the next room and we could hear the person talking and snoring at night. Otherwise highly recommended.","5"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","MSAhmed","Safety, a minimalistic setting and ze love in the air","Bang in the heart of Singapore. Has approach to two different roads at two different elevation levels. Safe hotel. Medium pricing. Rooms are small and cozy. SIngapore is space starved so don't expect big spaces unless you are ready to dole out big space bucks. This hotel's ambience is good. It has one of the best breakfast settings I know. Highly elegant and quiet. Overlooks a pleasant view of the road. High on romance, the quiet types for a steady couple. Or a casual break for a new au pair.  You can bunch out to any part of the city from here. The locale comes alive at night. In fact it the next time around I am gonna book it here.","5"

Breakfast was good, rooms were maintained well. Reception were also good. Staff at the YMCA were good host. Thank You YMCA for making our stay comfortable.","4"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","Josh M","Hotel with great downtown location!","The hotel location is superb, just a stroll away from downtown Orchard. This is the main reason we book the hotel, so that we have easy access to transportation and downtown area.   The room is quite old, but it is clean. This is probably one of the older hotels in Singapore. Room size is good, better than the hotel in its class. We did not book the room with breakfast, but there are many places around the hotel that serves a good breakfast. Within just a few minutes, there is furniture mall with local eateries.  We spend most of the time outside of the hotel, so we just use this hotel as our sleeping pad. The bed is of good quality. The location is also quiet and our room is overlooking the garden. They also have a nice and clean swimming pool, overlooking the garden. Wifi is¡¦","3"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","amathur2014","Well presented functionality","Possibly unbeatable in terms of price/value relationship...Singapore is an expensive city, certainly for accommodation; and the YMCA One Orchard scores on many fronts: its room rate, for one, reasonably priced for the city; its location in the city centre and close to a major metro station; and its impeccable standard. The rooms are small, but they do have closet space plus a kettle for hot water. They are functional and well maintained. The room and the en suite bathroom are spotless, and I do mean spotless. The staff are very helpful, and there is even a tour desk with a wide array of choices for those who wish to sightsee. I was not overly  impressed with the breakfast; but it's free, served hot and was plentiful. The whole package makes for very good sense. Would definitely¡¦","4"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","BluePlata","It's fun to stay at the...","It was my first time to visit Singapore and YMCA was the hostel that my parents picked.  Nothing fancy, but it was a nice stay. We stayed here for 3 nights.  Staffs are super friendly and helpful, rooms are clean and well maintained. I had issues though with the shower, (temperature not working) but I am not complaining.  Stay includes free buffet breakfast too!  WIFI was included in the stay, I am so thankful that it is since I did not have a source of mobile data with me.  They also helped us with booking a TAXI going to the airport.  Thinking of coming back in SG and will definitely consider booking again here.  Thank you YMCA for the hospitality!","5"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","dasreiseteam","Nothing fancy but a great location","The room was functional with 2 beds, a wardrobe and desk and very clean.  It had enough space for all our luggage and offered also free WiFi. The bathroom was big enough with a large walk-in shower. There was a main road right under our window (rear side of the building, 7th floor) but the traffic noise was minimal. Although the building and rooms show signs of aging the location makes up for it. We were within walking distance to Orchard- and Bugis Street, little India and even the Esplanade could be reached by foot. Both bus and MRT services are available right at the door step. The staff was friendly and helpful. No complaints about the breakfast which was a mix of European and Asian buffet items. We liked the food in the cafe on the 4th floor, especially the fish and chips.","4"

This is a great place to stay in a very expensive city like Singapore. No frills at a good price! Don't expect too much and you might be surprised. I was.","5"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","luckyeddys","Great Value for Singapore","Although we have stayed in numerous hostels throughout Asia, we had never stayed in a genuine YMCA. What a lovely surprise we had when staying here. Great location next to an MRT station and close enough to the major areas to walk if you prefer. The staff were always friendly and helpful and ready to greet you with a smile. The rooms are a good size with a good bathroom and are very clean. Breakfast was tasty with a large choice of foods, tea, coffee and fruit juices. This hostel is of a high standard and represents great value especially in Singapore. We would highly recommend it.","4"

They are smiling whenever anyone approaches the Reception Desk, or stops them! What a wonderful change to see sad, sullen faces. As this (hidden gem) is located:- 1) next to a church, and 2) on the edge of the 'famed' Orchard Road, within reach of the MRT, as well as bus routes, the location is ideal. Price wise, the tariff is reasonable, for the location.","4"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","98127634","Nice hotel with good location","Rooms are neat and clean. Buffet needs to be changed frequently..same food since past 4 years.but it is fresh and tasty. Excellent location  just next to many malls and mrt. Nice view from roof top. 24hrs hot and cold water. Friendly reception staff. Room cleaning staff a bit impolite. No payment hassles. Booking process was swift. Bus stop right next to ymca. In the suit ac works only on one side of the room. It was not rectified even after complaining.  Final comments....you can stay at this hotel...you wont be disappointed","4"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","MH_Sydney2010","Basic accommodation, fantastic rooftop pool","This basic hotel represents good value given the high prices in Singapore. It's well located, at the start of the Orchard Road shopping strip, near cultural institutions and handy to a couple of stations.  Room was dated but clean and a good size, it had two single beds. Bed was fine.  The great features of the hotel are the gym (I didnt use it as I belong to a gym chain) and the rooftop pool with great views. When I arrived someone else was just leaving so I had the pool all to myself.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.","4"

Very friendly & helpful staff. Breakfast (veg) spread needs to be better. We stayed here for almost a week and had the same breakfast everyday. Rooms are clean but very small in size. Love the pool on the roof. Definitely worth staying if you plan to be outside the hotel the max time.","4"
"d310344","YMCA One Orchard","nania","Great location but frowning staff","The location was nice indeed with easy access to every place you wish to visit in Singapore especially if you went there for shopping. Decent room and bathroom and they try to maintain the cleanliness. It's old building so expect some ants attacking your desk.  You need to switch on the power outside the bathroom to have hot shower and they didn't tell me before hand. I have to scream to my friend outside to call the receptionist about it and they told me to switch it on and wait for 30 minutes and she just cut the phone rudely. Turned out the hot shower work just right after it switch on and I don't have to stand there naked and cold.   I would love to stay here again considering the great price and not so bad room accompanied with breakfast. But here's the thing I want this¡¦","3"
