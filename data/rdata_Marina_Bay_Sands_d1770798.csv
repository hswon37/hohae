"d1770798","Marina Bay Sands","kumelys","awesome hotel,  definitely worth visiting once in my life despite high cost.","this was one of the most memorable hotels from many I stayed at in different countries. Infinity pool was awesome experience, access was only for hotel guests, but I fully understand that, it was full already and having outside visitors would not fit and make it very crowded and uncomfortable. My family of 3 persons was granted big family room as a bonus, although we booked cheapest option on lower floors and smaller size I think of 35m2. There were different restaurants on the top level, but we haven't been there, though they looked great and cozy. Only one small issue- there was no really hot water in the room, I called service, guy quickly came and let water run for some time, 5 mins or so and hot water finally arrived there. There are fancy shops around and Singapore tree light shows just outside.¡¦","5"
"d1770798","Marina Bay Sands","Sanav","Majestic Luxury","Marina Bay Sands is an engineering marvel and I spent a good amount of time just admiring its exterior beauty. We stayed in a family room for the first 3 nights (1 double bed and 2 single beds). The room is enormous, with more than adequate space for 4 adults, including your own balcony and 2 bathrooms (only 1 shower though). Unfortunately these rooms are on the lower levels of the hotel, so you do not get much of a view. However, for our final night we booked 2 deluxe rooms facing the harbour and these views were spectacular. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars to choose from, connected access to the mall across the street and a bridge to the famous Gardens by the Bay (take a trip at night for the full experience). The staff are friendly and helpful. The main attraction for me is the rooftop infinity pool, the largest of its kind in the world. The views afforded here are absolutely spectacular and due to its size, it doesn't feel too crowded. Simply a must visit. ¡¦","5"

The stay was expensive; $700 USD average per night for the cheapest room type. We stayed the other nights of the trip at the Grand Hyatt Singapore so that we wouldn't go broke on our trip. When we left the Hyatt to go check in at the MBS, we figured there would be no chance that our room would be ready. We checked in at 9:00 am and they not only got us a room right then, they also gave us one on a high floor (36) even though we had paid the cheapest rate which was for the bottom 10 floors.  The rooms are nice. Modern fittings and they come with little balconies. The beds are hard but the shower pressure is elite.

It is a little noisy though. For some reason it isn't as quite as expected.  The hotel itself was very busy. We had an exclusive lift which skipped the first 25 levels or so and free bottles of water which were very welcome considering the amount of people scattered in the lobby.  Despite being very busy, housekeeping did a very thorough job and went above and beyond. She (or he) folded my daughter's used pajamas and laid them on the huge bed.

"d1770798","Marina Bay Sands","JoanneInverness","Heaven on Earth","My daughter was desperate to stay at this hotel during our stopover on the way back home from Brisbane as she'd seen it get built on a previous visit.   There's a danger with a hotel of this scale (it is huge) for it to be soulless and impersonal, but we didn't find that to be the case.  From the minute we stepped out of the taxi, the service was faultless (although pool service quite slow), but most importantly friendly and personal.   We were on the 18th floor with a garden view and what a view!   But of course, the main attraction is the rooftop infinity pool and it didn't disappoint.

I had expedited check in and was able to get into my room a few hours earlier than standard check in time.  The hotel itself is enormous, which comes with the good and the bad. The good is that there are plenty of restaurants, places to explore and things to do. The bad is that it is very difficult to offer top quality service when there are so many guests.

Our deal included breakfast which gives a choice of three restaurants. Rise gives you the better breakfast but Spago has the views but also a queue. We stayed in a garden view room. Great views of the gardens by the bay. There is a very busy road in front of the hotel so sitting out on the balcony was noisy so if you want a garden view room go for a high floor. The hotel is attached to a luxurious shopping centre with expensive food options but there is a food court.","4"

Deluxe room with city view for 2 nights in early Jan costed about 1400 euro without breakfast. Hotel was fully booked apparently.The place is worth its money just because of the infinity pool and the extraordinary bay view from its top.The bed is a bid too hard for me and at the 38 floor you could still hear the noise of the cars down the busy street.

Overall the hotel is beautiful, the architecture inside and out is astounding and the surrounding area is immaculate. They rooms are OK, kinda dated and nothing special. The service level is very poor and had made for the worst hotel stays I have ever had. Especially for the steep rate.   Furthermore, if you are coming for the pool, forget it. The pool is far too overcrowded and quite filthy. Certainly not a pleasant experience even though the view is quite epic.   Elaborating on my service experience. Firstly, the amount of personnel on site is severely lacking. It is challenging to find anyone to assist you with even just a simple question.

The building seemed to go on forever with shopping, a casino, dozens of restaurants, and the Bayfront metro stop all accessible without ever going outside! But nothing compares to the pool!

It earns its 5 stars well and truly, but it lets itself down with some of the little things. We booked for 3 (wife, myself and 13yo daughter) but our room only came with a King Bed.

The service during our stay just continued in the same vein, with no one being particularly helpful or friendly. You're just paying for the views and that rooftop pool access - which are spectacular, in fairness. But when we stay at a luxury 5 star hotel we expect service to match the pricetag.

Not good as youll still be paying a fortune.  I suspect the cheaper rooms mostly go to package tourists - cannon fodder for the casino dowstairs.

The room didn¡¯t have international power converter. The view is very nice as always and the room gets cleaned nicely. The check in service is very attentive and good.

Though pool is only accessible exclusively by hotel guests. Breakfast spread is great. Plenty of options. Check in took a bit of time but check out was express. Just dropped room key to express check out drop box. While the per night room rate is expensive, it guarantees an impeccable service for its price. Overall, a very nice experience.","5"

Although it is a massive hotel and entertainment complex, it is broken up into three tall towers so that each floor only has about a dozen rooms. Same with the pool: it is broken up into three sections, with several levels of sunny and shaded lounge chairs and cabanas. It was well-used but never overcrowded, and we never had trouble finding the perfect place to relax.    We were impressed that this massive hotel was able to feel so intimate and relaxing.

Check in took a while, but we were given temporary access to the pool while we waited for the room, which was nice since we just stayed one night. We got an upgrade to an upper room facing the gardens with a small balcony, which was nice to watch the gardens show without having to leave.

You have your own balcony and the room is nice. I think that Singapore is just expensive in general. If you can stay for a night do it just for the views but overall I'm not sure it's worth the price. It is a one stop shop, you have restaurants, a casino, and shops but the hotel was an architectural beauty but there are other nice hotels in the area.

The curtains (both heavy and sheer) were all controlled by switches, which made it especially nice.   The highlight of the facility was the oft talked about infinity pool on floor 57. While it does get crowded around peak hours, making finding seats difficult, the view and the pool itself were exemplary.  The only problem we encountered was of other guests stealing towels that we'd set down on our lounge seats. I don't know how the hotel would fix that though.

We have stayed in many luxury and non luxury hotels in many countries so feel we can fairly say that this hotel is up there with the best of them.   I think some of the other comments have been a little unfair. Singapore is a very expensive city and MBS is an iconic hotel so you have to budget for spending more during your stay and be smart with what you spend.   Yes check in is very busy and there could be more seating in the lobby. Yes the pool is manic but to be honest if more guests put away their towels when leaving it would be easier to find a sun bed. Also some people bag them unnecessarily and don¡¯t use them. This is a problem with the guests and something the hotel needs¡¦","5"

Unfortunately, it is surely also the most crowded. It suffers from excessively loud music, too. There is no oasis of tranquility anywhere on the upper deck.  Otherwise, it was very much like any other four star hotel. Service what competent, polite and rules based. Queues were ubiquitous in August 2019 when we were there, even at the premium check facility. No turn down service. Toiletries not up to a five star standard, etc.   In short, not worth the USD/EUR/GBP 500 price we paid except for the experience of Asian tourism in 2019.","3"

The room was beautiful and clean.    The hotel was extremely crowded.  The reason I give the Marina Bay Sands four stars is because of the children at the pool.  There is an adults-only section of the pool, but many guests did not respect the signs, which were posted in multiple languages.
