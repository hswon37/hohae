"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","Christopher C","Fantastic but Expensive","After nearly two years of closure Raffles is back on the map. The whole building revamped into pristine  condition. When in Singapore it is a must to visit this place and see the splendour.  And of course sample the famous Singapore Sling. That been said the service was not as good as it should be. The wait for a menu and then the wait of over 20 minutes for a drink to be served were much too long and the staff did not seem busy. An expensive treat.","4"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","GregB052148","Stop for a Sling","When in Singapore you have toat least stop at the Raffles for a Singapore sling. It was first concocted here and is something you can check off the bucket list.  Warning---- it wont be cheap, but you may only be in Singapore once, go for it.","4"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","GERinAsia","Great Hotel for a short stay in Singapore","We enjoyed our long weekend thoroughly, the hotel has been tastefully renovated, the staff is superb and the breakfast was a delight. Nothing was too much trouble for our butler Bobby, who made our stay even more enjoyable. Congratulation to such a great hotel.","5"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","Deborah K","High tea with some history","This was an outstanding, although expensive, treat and something I've long wanted to do - High Tea at Raffles is not to be missed.  The building is fantastic, the staff are first class as is the High Tea itself.  Myself, my Son and his wife all attended here on New Years Eve for a very special, to us, morning tea.  I've been to many and varied other establishments for High Tea and come away positively starving.  None of us could finish our ""allotted"" assortment of sandwiches, pastries, and deserts, let alone the seemingly endless supply of scones, clotted cream, jam and tea.  This is an experience not to be missed.","5"

"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","mmj17","Not quite a 5","We stayed here , for 3 nights, and , whether it was because it had recently been reopened , but the service in some areas, was to be questioned, waiters forgetting drinks orders, pool attendants a bit vacant when asking for things, but apart from a  few very small things theres no doubting this is a classic place. Rooms are beautiful, modern comfy and luxurious.Highly expensive but once in a lifetime stay.","4"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","Perry B","The most amazing experience!","We had the most fabulous time here possible! It was a highly special stay from whoa to go! It started when we were met at Terminal One of Changi Airport by our fabulous chauffeur, Noor, who transported us to the Hotel in style and who was such a positive person, even assisting my wife with a toilet break and photo opportunities. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and everything sparkled festively. It felt like there was a Reception Committee at the Hotel once we arrived too. Yu Jun proved to be an excellent Butler and even arranged for a video of the choristers to be emailed when our own video had gotten ruined. We loved the personalised suite, the Joseph Conrad Suite at # 251 on the Balcony wing. it was the ultimate in refined and tastefully recently restored¡¦","5"

We were offered additional scones, that we accepted although heaven knows how we fitted them in!!","5"

From the welcome from staff on arrival to my personal attendant Kenny who even got me coconut ice cream at 1am when I couldnt sleep!. The room is immaculate, and airy with a confirtable bed dressing area and onsuite, desk and chairs. Fruit and papers were delivered and the room was cleaned every morning when I returned to the room, I could never figure out how they knew I has gone and come back, I found out they put a match stick by the door! so clever. This iconic hotel is worth staying in and you have to go to the monkey bar where you can have a singapore sling and throw monkey nuts on the floor. Singapore is beautiful and full of palm trees so clean. Although a short work trip I would love to come back here.","5"

Popped in the gift shop first on the ground floor then went up to the first floor and joined the queue for the Long Bar. After around 20/25 mins we finally managed to get in after a few people had left. First impressions were that it is not that big inside,and the floor was covered in nut kernals,well funny. At $35 each,we thought stuff it,only here once,so we had 2!. Bloody lovely. They do other cocktails and beer as well.","5"

These are the feelings I keep in mind after the memorable visit to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore! My goal was of course The Long Bar where you traditionally order and drink a real Singapore Sling - memorable, not least for the peanut shells on the floor!","4"

There was a line up to get into the bar on Sunday so we went back the next day at 3 pm and got in right away. They also serve at the pool bar if you want to avoid lines.

"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","matthewrafat","Afternoon High Tea is an Excellent Experience","If you visit Singapore, you'll of course go to a hawker centre and walk down Orchard Road. It used to be that you'd also order a Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel bar, but if you're into more elegant experiences, I suggest reserving afternoon high tea at the Grand Lobby cafe. It is expensive but worth it. (January 2020)","5"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","MargieDee","Long Bar - long wait!","It might be a long wait but worth it. Singapore sling is a bit pricey and really not that tasty (my opinion) but the atmosphere and history is definitely worth it.

The long bar is just wonderful and mesmerising. You can imagine in years before how it used to run. I ordered a 1915 and a Singapore sling. Both where excellent. I then went downstairs to the garden restaurant and received just wonderful service and even got told some history which bought it all to life. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. The staff where just amazing, the cocktails where superb and the food in the garden restaurant was just divine. Raffles you are simply a cut above the rest x","5"

I just CANNOT fathom how it is possible to spend so much money and so much time in renovating a top-notch hotel and NO COMPETENT or smart guy has brought the idea that not hearing every step from neighboring rooms could be kind of a good idea. Travelers like us do not particularly need to be shown how a bathroom works, but do need to get the very absolute basics when paying for a room, that is to get some sleep, which the Raffles DOES NOT provide, UNLESS:¡¦","2"

The signature Raffles Doorman was super welcoming and friendly upon checkin, and again as we were departing. What a unique and special touch. The renovated rooms are VERY nice and comfortable. We were especially pleased with the room-attendant service. Grace came to welcome us shortly after check in and helped us modify a dinner reservation that we were having difficulty with, she brought fresh milk for coffee, and she noticed our Rimowa suitcases which could be cleaned by the onsite Rimowa store. She took the suitcases and they were back within a couple of hours, freshly cleaned and wheels oiled. All in all, a great stay, next time will plan to stay longer!","5"

An old hand having stayed many previously times we were curious to see how the refurb had panned out. There is no doubt this is a wonderful hotel, on the whole with service to match. However I am amazed at the small mistakes made by such a large hotel group. The pool area, stupidly small sized umbrellas that could just about keep off the sun if you stand directly underneath. The steps to the pool too sharp, and were closed off after our first day pending modification, things like this the hotel know.

Two cocktails ¡Ì48! But it was worth it! There were monkey nuts available where we kept the tradition of throwing the empty shells on the floor!

We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights and had a state room which was absolutely gorgeous. One of the best in the world. The hotel is beautiful and well refurbished after being only reopened for 6 months.  Apart from that the hotel has issues and maybe it¡¯s due to the short re opening and the staff need more training. Overall the staff lack 5 star service. There are other hotels in Singapore that offer better more knowledgeable service. The concierge only knew about 5 restaurants between the 4 of them and they were all big hotel restaurants. The pool staff were completely inattentive.

The service was good overall, but should be better. We would have appreciated outreach from a concierge in advance of our stay to book tours through the hotel rather than our own. The head butler reached out a couple of days ahead of our arrival, which was nice, but we still ended up having to make requests for extra pillows, hangers, and plug adapters for our room.

Would rate the hotel at average to good at best and it really needs to up its game. The rooms at the newly refurbished hotel were exceptional and facilities adequate. Unfortunately the service was inconsistent, with the (many) exceptional members of staff being let down by the other poor members of staff. Service was generally indifferent and we were unable to make a reservation at any of the better restaurants - despite being residents - and simply told ""sorry we are fully booked"" We found the whole experience to be generally unacceptable for a hotel that is positioning itself at this level and charging accordingly.

Staff were on point, as one would expect given the reputation of Raffles, attentive and courteous but without being ""too much"".   The food on offer was all wonderful but it certainly isn't the place for those with either a seafood or gluten allergy - not a criticism, it is simply what it is and as someone with a seafood intolerance, I feel prospective patrons should be aware. The only other thing of note was the cost - again, not a criticism but many are unaware of both the service charge and GST applied to the Singapore experience, you need to allow for this if you're travelling on a tight budget!","5"

To be honest, you would get better, more efficient service at a local food court. To begin with, the staff were disorganised and not very efficient in serving the drinks and canapes in the courtyard with many guests going without drinks. The soft drink I had was watered down and tasteless.

The service staff were not familiar with drinks and could not even complete a simple order of drinks after half an hour. I think the staff were untrained and generally were standing around but did not respond to requests and most times got the orders wrong. Charging a six star price with abysmal service is not something the Raffles wants to be known for.","1"

The renovations that were recently completed have kept the character of the iconic hotel while updating it as well.  The conference hall we had was beautiful, with amazing frescos on the walls.    On the other hand, and perhaps it can be chalked up to teething issues, but the service and events staff were subpar.  We basically had to do a lot of the troubleshooting ourselves.

We were offered a tea menu which my husband I chose from, then later offered more tea which we chose. When the bill came we had to pay extra for these 'special teas' totalling about 40 quid of tea. Now I like tea but it really was not that special and I felt that they should have said these 'teas' were extra as would have been quite happy with normal tea. When you are paying a premium for an experience I don't expect these type of hidden extras and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth (not tea) !","4"

An overnight stay is over $1,000 per night. But in the Long bar they serve the very good Singapore Sling (at $32/glass) which was invented at Raffles and they give each table a free bag of unshelled peanuts. Of course the floor is littered with peanut shells. It makes me wonder about the larrikin (ruffian) travellers of years gone by that had a laugh when they stayed at Raffles. It also reminds me of a cowboy bar in San Antonio Texas which was the first place that I experienced a bar floor littered with peanut shells.

Actually, they keep working, so you may want to check on status, in particular re bars.  Breakfast is excellent, with some nice ideas (such as raspberries and some British specials). The pool is nice, though not spectacular, but there are better ways to spend time at the Raffles than in the pool. And yes, you can throw peanuts, and it is fun.

To be honest the peanuts were dry and tasteless but you have to eat and throw the shell on the floor. The pool balls on the billiard table were sacrilege. The Singapore sling is overpriced at Singapore $36 (including service charge and tax) but has to be drunk and enjoyed because of the cost and the history.

Unfortunately, there is major construction ongoing at this time so we were not able to see and admire the beautiful entirety of the hotel. We were able to enjoy our first Singapore Sling!

However, trust us to visit when it¡¯s getting a makeover and the beautiful facade was hidden by dust cloths and the Long Bar is closed for renovations! The Billiard Room Bar is beautiful and apparently the last tiger was killed in there whilst cowering under a billiard table in 1902, as an animal lover, I could have lived without knowing that little snippet which is on the menu!  A Singapore Sling is also a must have, but like a gondola ride in Venice, also a must do, but ridiculously expensive! It was $36. A large bag of monkey nuts is given when you sit down and the husks are all over the floor! It reeks of history and is definitely worth a visit but Singapore Sling or not, the drinks in the bar are expensive.","4"

It is true, although we haven't had a Sling in Sing to compare them to.  The original home of the Sling (Long Bar) was closed for renovations, so we had them in the Billiard Room instead.   The vibe was festive, with loads of patrons all looking suave in heels and jackets sipping Slings whilst the floor was covered in the discarded shells of the complimentary nuts. The juxtaposition was nice.  The Slings aren't cheap at around $25 a pop, but the recipe has reverted to the original which probably makes its more worthwhile.","4"

The reduction in available rooms doesn't seem to have been matched by reductions in staffing levels, so the service was at least as good as ever, but with a slightly more intimate atmosphere.  The only slight inconvenience was having to use the Fairmont pool over the road, but it was hardly an issue as we were escorted there by Raffles staff.

The hotel is currently under construction which the group organizers were not advised until just prior to our arrival.

I would love to go back when it is up and running in its full splendor! I did love the charming room and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but the integrity of the property loaned itself to that for which I am ok.

I could not understand initially how the staff knew that a guest had returned to the room and if a glass had been used it had been cleaned and returned to the room (I did work it out but I will not divulge their secret).

Although the hotel was under renovation, we did not hear or experience any nusance. The suite was magnificient and the fact that the hotel has been there for approx. 100 years, gave us a priviledge feel! Downside is that due to the large number of tourists visiting the Raffles, the Bar & Billiard Room was packed and there was not able for us to sit. Also breakfast the next morning, we had to wait more than 5 minutes before a table outside was made available. I guess they were understaffed at that very moment.

Our butler was probably just doing his job by trying to push us to upgrade to a bigger suite, but after travelling for more than 20 hours, it didn't sit well with us, he was just too pushy. He should have read the signs, especially since we made it clear that we were tired and just wanted to settle in the room we booked.

Although the hotel is closed for renovations until next year, the ""Billiard Room"" is still open as a bar to serve the famous cocktails.  My husband and I visited on a Sunday lunchtime. We had to queue for about 10 minutes for a table, but once you are seated you are not rushed.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful. We had two Singapore Slings, a bottle of sparkling water and a club sandwich between us and the bill came to the equivalent of ¡Ì60. On the expensive side, but we're on holiday and it's once in a lifetime.","5"
"d301583","Raffles Hotel Singapore","nmph2017","Been going here since the 1950's","Being renovated (again) but helps that it keeps a lot of tourists out and is therefore peaceful. There used to be a photo of me on Santas' lap taken in 1956. It is now archived. Suites were limited but we were able to get into the Rudyard Kipling Suite which like the other 'personality suites' is quite large with the bedroom seperate to the living room. We ate out a lot more for convenience than anything. Although you have to cross the road to the Fairmont to use the pool the standard of service at the Fairmont pool was on a par with Raffles itself. (All charges at the Fairmont are linked back to Raffles) They still pick you up at Changi in the rollers. It'll be interesting to see what it looks like when finished next year.","5"
