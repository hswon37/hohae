"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Jazz","Nice location but if you sensitive with noise this place is going to be your nightmare","Stayed here for the second time. This time I booked suite because I prefer to pay double price for privacy and wanted to have a full sleep as you never known what kind of bunkmate you would have.  But the whole 5 night turned my trip to be the worse trip of the year, I could not sleep peacefully at all. The suite close to the bathroom you will hear the door slam for the entire night and getting worse from 6AM. - 10AM. plus the suite itself has separated door and there is 5 suite together each one has own door but the wall is not soundproof at all (you hear even the next suit mate snoring) I heard the doors slam 10-20 times each minute!!!  It is so horrible I had few hours sleep each night and got so exhausted during the days and couldn't enjoy the trip at all. This place is not for me and never again. ¡¦","3"

Not for the claustrophobic.  I've  never been asked before if I was capable of hearing a fire alarm.  Bottom line - fire trap","3"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Chrisnox N","The best hostel in Singapore","I have stayed in various hostels in Singapore and this one is the best! It is very clean. It looks modern industrial and stylish. It looks and smells new. The beds are really nice. Rooms are spacious. Strong Wifi connection everywhere. The toilet and shower area are clean and stylish. Breakfast is the best compared to Singapore hostels. Service is top notch. Price is worth it. In front of a bus stop. They have an elevator. Complimentary use of washer and dryer. I will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended.","5"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Janice","Great budget hotel in singapore","I stayed 5 nights at The Pod, stayed in their Pod suite and absolutely loved it. Staying in the Pod Suite meant that i had an entire room to myself. Although this was a small room, it was very functional room (comes with a small work station) that gave a lot of privacy. The room itself felt very secure, with two sets of doors (both requiring key card entry), with the building itself also requiring keycard entry. this is something that was really important to me as a solo female traveler.   Hotel also comes with a bunch of amenities such as free towels, free brekky, water filling station, and shampoo, and is situated in a very convenient location, within walking distance to the MRT station, artsy Haji lane and a bunch a really good eats.   Staff here were also very friendly and hospitable, thanks for an awesome stay!¡¦","5"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Ludovicov","Highly recommended","We loved our stay at the Pod Hostel. We spent here 4 nights, one night in the queen suite and the other in the queen bed mixed dorm. The pod guarantees all the privacy you need, so much o that it feels like being in your own private bedroom.  The bed is very comfy and spacious and had everything you need. All the facilities were super clean. The bathroom are self contained which is a nice plus when staying in a hostel! They also provide lots of useful amenities, such as free breakfast, free towels, soaps and shampoo, free drinkable water to refill your bottle. There is also the possibility to do your laundry for free, which is a huge bonus point! The location is perfect to explore Singapore, just steps from Haji Lane.  The staff was very helpful and friendly, even when we arrived at 2am because of a flight delay.  They offer a 24/7 check in which is a nice touch. Our experience at the Pod Hostel was beyond our expectations and we will highly recommend it to anyone coming to Singapore.¡¦","5"

The checkin staff were very polite and they upgraded by pod to a queen pod. Under the bed there is locker where you can store you luggage. I stayed in the all women pod on a seperate floor and you had to use the access card to enter the building, floor and room. There had a well set up shared dressing area with iron board and the showers/loos were clean. Please note in the mornings it can get a bit crowded and you might have to wait your turn. Breakfast was included and it was a good spread.  Overall I highly recommend this place for solo female travellers on a budget","5"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","D4rkL1ght96","Great for a short stay!","I stayed here with my Mum in October for 3 nights and it definitely exceeded our expectations. It doesn't look like much from the outside but is a great little modern hotel on the inside. Before you get to your room you need to remove your shoes and there are lockers to keep them in. You'll also see the bathrooms equipped with both a toilet and shower before entering your room. In your room is 8-10 pods, half of which are on the upper part accessible by a ladder. Our pod was a double bed pod on the bottom. Beneath each lot of pods are also storage for bags and suitcases. The storage might look small but goes right back is definitely sufficient. The storage is also locked with your room card. Inside the pod there's lights and charging points and a screen you can pull down for¡¦","5"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Namcy C","Lovely stay in SIngapore","Check in on 3rd floor, and accommodation is only level 4-5. (floor 5 provide laundry). What I love about this place is the decoration (cozy&modern) and a small foldable table attached to bed which you can enjoy series or even work. If you love a place to hangout at night, it's perfect with outdoor dining. The staff are nice and explain everything once you first arrive. Cleanliness is very good in bedroom and bathroon. Also the breakfast is lovely with toast, cereal, sausage, fried noodle, mushroom with cheese. The dining area is friendly environment. So this place makes you feel like you are staying at home. Anyway, one thing can be approved like carpet in the bedroom (but it's no big deal) Overall, i enjoy staying here.","4"

When I first entered the guest reception, I was impressed by the clean atmosphere and the staff greeted me nicely.   I was briefed about the hotel by Travis and he showed me to my capsule and explained how the locker and toilet works, he even entertained my questions and queries throughout the trip, especially with regards to transport and places of interest.   I like that each capsule has its personal table and light, which makes you feel like you are actually in a small private room of your own, which is very cosy. The place also has water refill machines, which I¡¯m so thankful for as I drink a lot of water, so I¡¯m so happy that I need not constantly purchase a new bottle at the convenience¡¦","4"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Evon C","Good location and decent pods","Nice and decent beds with shared bathrooms. It is better to get the front entry rather than side entry to minimise noise.  Suites are noisy as I can always hear opening/closing doors and when the person  next door climbs up his/her upper bunk.  Side entry lower bunk is very noisy due to the upper person going up and down the bed.","4"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Wei","Awesome experience like being home","#clean I¡¯m sensitive about how a space smells like, and what amazed me first was its home-like smelling in all areas, including the lobby, the room and the shower. I think that was the smelling of ¡°safe and clean¡± mixed with perfume and soap.  #warm The other thing that made me feel like home was the smiles and the warm services. I¡¯m here to give a special thank to the day shift receptionist, Travis, for his kindly Chinese guide and help. I¡¯ve always feel happy to meet people who enjoy their jobs and perform in a heart moving way.  Because of the awesome experience and the rest part of Singapore that I haven¡¯t experienced, I¡¯ m sure I¡¯ll visit there soon although I just back to Taiwan several hours ago lol.","5"

"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Michael Lewis","So handy to visit the highlights of Singapore","This place is in an excellent location. It is just 5 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station and close by streets packed with restaurants and bars for night life.   For central Singapore it is a great place to stay if you are on a budget or a quick visa run from Thailand. We had an individual pod and although we could hear people in the pod above, it was OK and what you would expect from a hostel type place.","4"

The room is clean and the room cleaning service is good. The air conditioning is a bit cold for me.   There are shoe lockers to keep your shoes since no shoes are allowed in the pod areas.   Simple breakfast is served from 7.30am till 9.30am.   There are also self-checked in kiosk where you can check-in by yourself. The receptionist is kind to show me and help me to check in.   The hotel is within walking distance from Bugis MRT (very convenient to go to Changi Airport). Haji Lane and Arab Street is nearby as well.","4"

"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","The Travelling Ambivert","So good, I'm returning again this year","I was quite uncertain about what to expect from The Pod as I'd never stayed in a capsule hotel before and have horrible experiences of hostel/ shared space accommodation in the UK/ Europe. The Pod put all Western hostels to shame. It operates at such a standard that is far above its two-star status. There should be an entirely different marking scale for accommodation such as this, as I'd glad say it is a 2.5 - 3.5 property. There are some pros and cons to staying here.  The Pros: Location - Kampong Glam is a lively, colourful neighbourhood close to Chinatown, Bugis Station, Raffles Hotel and a few stops away from Marina Bay on the MRT. There are so many food options, more than I had time to sample.  Staff - Shout out to Robin! I had a late check-in and he knew that it was me¡¦","4"

There is no ac duct inside capsule. It gets little hot inside in the night time. The washroom have no exhaust, there is a vent but it's of no use. It can get really hot and suffocating at times specially after hot shower. Chair needs to be placed at the washroom door to keep it open for venting purpose. The staff were friendly and polite.

Everything in the shared area to the rooms itself was aesthetically pleasing. The beds were great as well, with everything you'll need in a capsule pod and more. There was a foldable table, lights, pillows, blankets, shelves and lockers, all cleverly arranged in a neat, practical and aesthetic manner. Overall, the capsule hotel exceeded my expectations and I'll definitely recommend to other friends.","5"

When I arrived, I was greeted by Eva at the reception and she was very nice and gave me a warm welcome. The checking in process was fast and I was shown to my pod. The area was cosy, and each pod comes with a warm yellow light and small table. The bed was comfortable, just that the blinds were too loud during movement and I could occasionally hear traffic. Only one socket is provided in the bed area, so it was a little troublesome for me as I had to wake up to change the charging device from my phone, to my portable charger, to my camera.

As a solo traveler, it was very easy to meet others at the hostel. The 3rd floor lobby is the best place to meet others and has good music (shout out to DJ Hemant). The facilities are pretty clean and there is everything you need - laundry, iron, showers, toilets, etc. Some critical feedback - for context, I stayed at Cube Boutique Capsule Hostel prior to this.

In fact, it was connected to several other ¡®private¡¯ rooms and shared the same A/C unit. The room itself was very poorly designed and did not make the most of the space available. The bed was a bunk bed, but for some reason the top bunk was blocked off, which meant that there was no space to put suitcases. Worst of all, the walls are paper thin and there is also a vent above the door. This meant that any noise from the several other connecting rooms could be heard.

The pod itself is quite basic (lamp, power point, locker) but the mattress is comfy.  Footwear must be put into the shoe lockers on each floor to keep the areas clean.

Refurbishment was happening during our stay so I would check on this if you have a layover and want to sleep in because in the day their was noise. We had no access to toilet or shower facilities on our floor due to the renovation which was a pain and meant more people using the other 2 bathrooms so people had to queue. One of our nights was a Friday and 2 other showers could not be used because the doors had been painted. It was a really busy night and people were still trying to shower at 2400. 4 showers between 3 floors of guests feels like bad planning. If the renovation was not going on I would have scored the pod higher but there was not even notice of this on their website.¡¦","3"

I definitely like the Single Pod Suite a lot more than the dorm-style units. It was a good fit for me, a person who values privacy but still needs budget accommodation. It's not 100% quiet but I felt it was definitely quieter than in the dorm unit because you don't hear people rummaging for stuff just a few inches away from your bed.

I very much appreciated the free use of laundry facilities and the hairdryer and iron in the bathroom! Luxuries for a traveller! The bathroom mats were always soaking wet when you used the toilet so this could be checked on a little more often. The only issue I had was the lack of respect from other guests, as other reviews have commented on. It can be really noisy early in the morning and late at night with people slamming doors/draws/talking which was really annoying. This is no fault of the hostel though.","4"

For the price of this place you are better off getting a normal hostel bed as you will have more room to move and still have breakfast included.

The reception was helpful, the shower/ toilets are spacious & clean, no waiting because I like to shower in 'unusual' times, the choice of breakfast was really wide, there's a microwave and fridge you can use.

It's basically a hostel with the usual hostel type guests and hostel type staff- that well, couldn't be bothered. It is also very loud.

The common area is just tables and chairs for breakfast, there is no comfy sitting area w sofa or anything. Location is pretty good and close to public transportation.

It is SO noisy!  We booked a double private room for 5 nights, the rooms are small but as advertised and kind of fun. However there is zero sound insulation between the walls and there is even a large open grill above your door for airflow. You can hear when the people next to you whisper, although most people do not bother keeping quiet and will talk and bang about all night. Also, all the door and locks are very heavy and make loud noise anytime anyone enters or exits the area.

I usually stay in hotel rooms but I couldn't resist finding out more about Pods.  I opted for the Single Pod Side Entry in the Female Dormitory. They gave free eye masks and ear plugs (which you can claim during check-in) - I thought that was a nice touch.  I had almost everything I needed in that Pod. And privacy. I had the top bunk so it was a little inconvenient when I wanted to search for something in my luggage. This was because I had to climb down the stairs, bend over and reach for my luggage under the bottom bunk.  Otherwise, everything else was fabulous. The security when entering the dorms, the key they provided you for the luggage-storing cupboard under the bunk bed, plugs and lights by my bedside.¡¦","4"

BUT if you have NO problem walking about 10-13 mins from nearest metro station (BUGIS), then you can stay in this hostel.  TOILET is clean... BUT everybody can have an access to it even if you are staying in single dorm so you have to wait for your turn or queue outside the toilet and shower room. I suggest assign at least 1 toilet/shower room for those who are staying in private rooms.  Clean and affordable hostel. The buffet breakfast is simple enough to fill you till midday/before lunch.

The bed was up a ladder which to be honest was the biggest inconvenience, it's not the easiest ladder to climb up or down and the drop was about 6ft. Even my boyfriend found it difficult and that's saying something. Overall bed was comfy and the bathroom facilities were clean. Breakfast was so basic, sugary cereal, toast or a dried boiled egg.

They did a mistake of providing toilets and showers togheter, so if someone goes to pee, other one cannot take shower. That makes the bathrooms be busy any time, with people queuing for a shower. They were also very dirty and we complained to the staff and they just didn't care. We saw other people also complaining and didn't take any action while we were there (4 days). Breakfast time was very short and early (from 7:30 to 9:30), so everybody woke up and run to the breakfast at 9:00am, again queuing for breakfast but the food was not replaced, leaving people without food.

I stayed in a single suite room and had the table and upper bunk. Size was as expected.   The bedroom was clean and comfortable, the aircon was a bit too cold at first but they made it warmer at my request. (2 airconditioners service 5 pods through open grills at the top of the door). Slight downside is that it's pretty much no soundproofing, although the closed door gives that impression, so some people inadvertently made too much noise. But that's okay, fall asleep to somebody else's D&M conversations and you kind of expected that at a capsule hotel anyway!

You get a key card when you check in and can store your bags/luggage in a cupboard by your bed and only you can access it, it's great for security.

However, the pods are tiny, the rooms very warm (need better air conditioning) and the ladders leading up to the higher bunk beds are poorly designed and kind of dangerous for anyone who isn't moderately fit.

A wide variety of restaurants within walking distance. Staff was extremely kind and helpful. The little pod for sleeping was comfortable and well lit. air conditioning was very good and I was able to comfortably breath in this closed environment. The place was of average cleanliness. The bathrooms could be maintained a bit more since it was constantly wet, but this is also due to some guests wrong use I guess. Breakfast was great for the price paid.

So you booked a single but get a shared room. You will hear everything from your neighbors. Every morning the breakfast buffet has changed. Tip: You should go to breakfast between 9:30 and 10:15, so the service will refill up the buffet. The location is perfect to discover this amazing city.

The only reason I deducted a point was because of their inflexible booking policies. I was meant to fly in from the other side of the world but the airline overbooked my flight.

There's not much room in every unit, so you'll have to keep just the strictly necessary with you, while you can store the rest in the locker at the bottom of each pod. The privacy is provided by a rollup curtain, which lets people see inside if your light is on. You have to leave your shoes at the entrance of every section before going into rooms or the common washing areas, toilets, showers.  The toilets and showers are not very clean, despite being serviced quite often. I blame the customers. They also provide quite poor a breakfast you have to eat mostly on a large table.","3"

If you are outgoing and friendly enough, you might get to meet people from all over the world who will share their stories with you and make new friends.   What I love about The Pod is their clean toilets and comfortable bed (mattress).

Whilst I had felt the shared PODs were good, the suites are perfect for business travellers.  Provides sufficient privacy when you are working on your laptop because you get your own personal workspace. The individual keycard access to the POD suite makes it feel like a regular hotel room (albeit much smaller) and you don¡¯t have to deal with the occasionally person snoring beside or above you. One thing to note is the Suites while private, are not 100% soundproof and you can¡¯t blast your favourite music in the suite.

It's tiny, and I don't mean the pods, but the breakfast area, the checking area and there was a queue for the showers in the morning as there were only 2 showers (3 normally but 1 was out of order) for 20 pods, which means queuing up.. The breakfast is bare minimum as well. There's free coffee and toast bread.  For a 'boutique' style, I would have expected a little more space to relax for the guests, not in the pods but in the lobby for instance.","3"

But it was clean and tidy, air conditioned and a cool location. Lockable boxes under the beds. Very close to Arab st and sultan mosque which was bustling and vibrant as the sun went down, all the eateries came to life and spilled out into the street which were shut off. Cool place","4"

Not much breakfast choice (mandatory to opt for breakfast in agoda). Bathroom was pretty clean but shampoo wasn't replenished quick enough.  Staff service was remarkable. They were friendly and helpful.","4"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Ami Willis","Very enjoyable stay","Me and my sister stayed here for 2 nights in June. We found the hotel to be clean and well maintained throughout the stay and the staff were always very helpful. The breakfast was good and very filling and there is a coffee machine available 24 hours a day which really helped cope with the jet lag! We stayed in a side access bed which I preferred personally, there is a charging point and table in the bed which were useful throughout the stay. The upkeep and decoration of the hotel were generally very good however the bathrooms did get slightly dirty later in the mornings- there is not much that could be done to stop this though as it is a popular place with lots of people going through the showers! Overall we would definitely recommend The Pod as we had a very enjoyable stay¡¦","4"

I arrived in the middle of the night since my flight was delayed by 3hours. This all based on my personal experience.  Pros:  - Good location for travelers. - Budget friendly for solo backpacker. - Near Nicole and Bugis MRT Station. - Free mini breakfast buffet. - Free coffee, tea and water all day. - Modern design and comfortable bed. - Friendly and helpful staffs. - Free self service laundry.  Cons: - Noisy roommates. - Dirty bathrooms. - No free bottle waters as promise. - People come and go in the middle of the night. - Electric outlet not working on my pod. - They will not change you towels. - Never fix my bed. - Crowded dinning area.

They never answered my emails and when I called they were rude and clueless. Nothing really changed when I got there. The staff clearly don't give a falafel. No bottled water - as was listed and no locker to keep my valuables safe - as was listed.  The pod itself, average at best. The blind offers little privacy and the walls are paper thin so you'll hear everything including the loud breather at the other end of the room.  The bathroom and toilet facilities. Okay if you get in right after they clean them, which is only once a day - definitely something they need to rethink considering the volume of guests using them.  The laundry facilities - well, it'd be okay if if wasn't where¡¦","1"

Their breakfast was good though no labels for food and I had almost eaten chicken, though being a vegetarian. Having said that, I still had an enjoyable time having almost a hostel experience. Felt like a teenager with many carefree young guys and girls around. I loved their Coffee that was available 24 hours. They had a high speed WiFi and I was happy using it to max. The beds are quiet comfortable and one can easily have their privacy if they wanted to be up till late. But there are some things that could easily have been better. First of all, reaching The Pod wasn't easy as hardly anybody knew about Kampong Glam. So I got down at some nearby place and then kept going round and round finding it in¡¦","4"

The place is really nicely located, just a few minutes away from the Bugis train station, and in a very cool neighbourhood filled with great places to eat and small shops. The staff there is really helpful and the place really neatly designed. We slept really well (a claustrophobe wouldn't have). A big plus is the free dry cleaning service and the laundry machines! The breakfast is a bit disorganised but nothing too bothering.","4"

I never stay at hostel before so decide to give it a try . stayed at their pod suites . i can say this hostel was modern,nice and clean . The pod suites is good if you want to have so call your own room to yourself , but it might be abit noise if other guest talk loud as they is no soundproof . breakfast was good . i thought it will be only bread and cereal but turn out to be a buffet style with variety of food! nice touch for the free coffee and tea for 24hr , love the cappuccino! free laundry as well . they do provide guest for free dry cleaning service but i did not use this service . staff service was excellent . all staff was well train and able to help you whenever you need help! just¡¦","5"

The Bad-  They don't do enough in managing to make sure that all hostel guests are being respectful. For example, while they state that they close the main room lights at 11 to remind people to be remember to be quiet at night, no one actually comes around to close the lights so often they remain on all night, and rude guests will have full on conversations and play music when they return late at night or wake up early in the morning, ruining everyone else's sleep.  Additionally, their service isn't great. One of my shirts was ruined by whomever they use for dry-cleaning, and The Pod was absolutely terrible at keeping me¡¦","3"

Two years ago they did not have butter knife, on the third day of my recent visit I found them on the counter top, however only for 2 days, don't understand why? Coffee machine was very good in the previous year, however, it has some problems now: overflowing the cup and the coffee ('long-dark') tasted like dishwasher water.   The designer of this boutique hotel sure put in a lot of efforts for the look of things. For example, the colour scheme is dark and warm, however not too friendly to older folks with regression eye sight. The sound level is too high for a comfortable rest. The kitchen trolley can sure be fitted with quieter wheels. Doors banging automatically especially when the late comers just check-in after you fall asleep, at any hours I¡¦","3"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Dominic L","Enjoyed our stay","We stayed a day and had a great experience. Check in was smooth, and got to our area within a short period of time. Shower area was clean and water was hot. They were renovating the area behind the washroom area on our floor, and seemed like they were doing this on other floors as well. They have enough staff to tend to guests, but that will be determined once they expand. They will also need to add the number of washer/dryers to service the increase in guests that will likely fill the hostel. Our room's pods were filled and everyone was relatively quiet for a good nights sleep. I would recommend this as a place to stay and would like to come back again.","4"
"d4727829","The Pod Boutique Capsule Hotel","Soon Theam K","Pods Private, but Bathrooms need a bit of Sprucing","As always the pod provides a balance between value and privacy, allowing one to travel budget but still with some privacy.   These pods are not the typical Japanese kind of capsules you find in Japan, they are tall enough you can sit upright in them, and depending on whether you take the front entry or side entry, rather large entrances into the pod.   Highly recommended, but the bathrooms could probably use a bit of sprucing, the shower rails no longer hold up the shower heads properly.   Also, there are some renovations in the units next to the pod, so during the day plenty of workers are coming in and out of the lifts, so there might be some delays in getting a lift.","4"

This place is advertised as a budget business hotel but I could not really imagine being in Singapore on business and staying there. As a hostel it is fine. Infrastructure is relatively new though looking worn already. As for the pods, they don't really breathe well so I wouldn't recommend them as they can get a little warm without the AC being able to penetrate them. Breakfast was OK. I definitely took advantage of the complimentary coffee and laundry services. Though there were only 2 washers and 2 dryers so I had to wait a long time before using them.

Although the bathrooms had 'luxurious' trappings, the shower holder was broken, the glass was so dirty it looked frosted, and the all the bins were full and starting to smell.  2.

I checked-in on Sunday and checked-out on Friday and my bed wasn't made even once, forget about changing the sheets. The towels was also the same as the one I was provided the first day.   I mentioned this to a manager /supervisor and she told me that the staff make the bed every three days (I stayed for 5 days) and when the bed is free of personal belonging (I had kept all my belonging in my locker).   Sadly this experience had made me decide to make this my last stay at The Pod.","2"

The hotel is well designed and maximizing all the spaces since they didn't have a very large area.  The receptionist desk and the lobby is next to the dining area. They served a various and yummy breakfast. The bathroom is clean and quite large. They have one dorm in every floor and have several bed in it.  If you came with bunch of friends or in groups (not family with kids) I recommended you to stay here because it's near the haji lane, Sultan Mosque, not far from the MRT Station, market and also many restaurants around.","4"

I see there are people who talks about too little shower rooms, but I find it OK (I usually have my showers around 11:00 at night).  Only thing is, one of the showers were broken the whole time I was there, and it did not get fixed.   I think the Pod lived up to its name, it's a pod, so space was quite limited.  There weren't even space for me to put my phone and a bottle of water.

I checked it out 2 weeks before as I was staying at Parkroyal on Beach Road across the road & chanced upon it. It's good for its value & very convenient for food (lots of middle eastern/turkish) & getting transport to other parts of Singapore. The girls got to share rooms with their friends without having to share with strangers. A few parents also stayed there. From what I heard, everyone was happy. I think its a matter of keeping in mind that this is a hostel - you get all kinds of travellers. Some more considerate than others & some snore more than others!! You have to share rooms with strangers if you are on a budget.","4"
